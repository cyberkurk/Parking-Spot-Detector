#Parking Spot Detector

#Overview
This repository contains a Parking Spot Detector model implemented using OpenCV, scikit-learn, and Python. The goal of the project is to detect and visualize available parking spots in images or video streams.

#Features
Detection of parking spots in images or video frames.
Visualization of detected parking spots with bounding boxes.
Integration of scikit-learn for training a custom classifier (optional).

#Dependencies
OpenCV: The computer vision library used for image processing and object detection.
scikit-learn: Optional for training a custom classifier.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation in Python.
